# AutoBillCare: Automated Bill Management for Families

Empowering busy households to track and pay bills effortlessly.

---

## 🚨 Problem

- Middle-class families juggle dozens of monthly and annual bills (utilities, internet, insurance, etc.), often due on different dates.
- Tracking due dates and renewals manually is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Missed or late payments can lead to fees, service interruptions, and financial stress.
- Insurance renewals and subscriptions add yearly complexity on top of monthly bills.
- Overall, managing bills across accounts causes anxiety and wasted time for many households.

---

## ✅ Solution

**AutoBillCare** is a subscription service that automates recurring bill management end-to-end:

- Users consolidate all bills in one platform: electricity, water, gas, internet, insurance, and more.
- The system tracks upcoming due dates and automatically pays bills on time (with user-approved funding).
- **Portfolio** (our proprietary report) provides an annual visual report showing spending trends and inflation on all bills.
- This simplifies budgeting and ensures families never miss a payment or renewal.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Onboarding**: Clients link bank accounts and bill providers or upload bills. Setup takes minutes and one time setup.
2. **Subscription Fee**: We charge a 3–5% handling fee on total bill amount once in an year (e.g., $100 bill → $3–$5 fee).
3. **Automated Payments**: Payments are scheduled and executed securely on due dates, which we will be handelling.
4. **Dashboard**: Centralized view of all bills, due dates, and payment statuses.
5. **Annual Portfolio Report**: Clear visual insights on yearly costs, trends, and category-wise inflation.
